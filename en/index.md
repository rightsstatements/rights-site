# For cultural heritage institutions

RightsStatements.org provides a set of standardized rights statements that can be used to communicate the copyright and re-use status of digital objects to the public. Our rights statements are supported by major aggregation platforms such as the Digital Public Library of America and Europeana. The rights statements have been designed with both human users and machine users (such as search engines) in mind and make use of semantic web technology. Learn more about how you can use our rights statements [here]({{site.url}}/en/documentation#use-by-cultural-heritage-institutions).
